It’s the a heap new system to struggle through for modeling machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would you want to get through that heap instead of facing each ML engine one on one? Like when you need random forest, you reach out for ranger, or when you need linear regression, you reach out for the good old lm() in base R.\nTidymodels supposedly offers a uniform syntax to apply various ML engines. When you deal with them without tidymodels, they brought with them their own various syntax, and you need to deal with their unique parameters and function structures. With tidy models these things are streamlined, no matter what engine you face, you can use the same parameters and arguments.\nBut does it work really work as you expect? Mostly. But not all the time. Those unique characteristics from the original ML engines does not perish completely. They show their face usually when you try to tune them. Also, when something crapped on your code, it’s a bit harder to identify the problem, since modeling with tidymodels has multiple layers to it. Is the problem in the engine set up? Or is it the tuning grid? Perhaps, the recipe?

Yeah you should, especially if you have a good grasp on general programming skills with R and love Tidyverse.\nMe? What about my frustrating experience with tidymodels? Gimme a break. It was not only frustrating but also quite fun.
