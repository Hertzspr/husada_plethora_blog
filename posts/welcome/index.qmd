Ahoy\~!,

I had been wondering for a while whether or not to start a blog. I thought a simple [ShinyApp](https://8k2lvx-sasmito0yudha-husada.shinyapps.io/syh_cv/ "my portfolio") is sufficient as portfolio to help my transition into data science.

So far it's not enough and I rarely update that anyway. There are several new projects I've done but not updated in that ShinyApp. I will update it in bulk, later.

Meanwhile, here I am starting a blogging journey with quarto.

Here's a picture of my cat for your wasted time reading this post:
